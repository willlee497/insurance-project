Analyzing over 65,000 consumer complaints filed against insurance companies in Connecticut

Our goal is to uncover which insurers are most responsive to consumer needs by examining complaint frequencies, resolution times, financial recovery amounts, and sentiment trends. By identifying patterns in complaint data and predicting potential outcomes, our project aims to guide Connecticut residents toward more trustworthy insurance providers while showcasing the value of data science in transforming raw information into actionable insights.
